                The Idea of You is a 2024 American romantic comedy drama film directed by Michael Showalter from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jennifer Westfeldt, based on the novel of the same name by Robinne Lee. Starring Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine, it chronicles the love affair between a single mother and the lead singer of a popular boy band.

                A film adaptation of the novel was announced in late 2018 by the producers Cathy Schulman and Gabrielle Union; no further development was made until in mid-2021 with the involvement of Westfeldt, Hathaway, Showalter, and Galitzine being announced. The film was shot by cinematographer Jim Frohna predominantly in Georgia, United States, during late 2022. Peter Teschner edited the film while Siddhartha Khosla composed the original score. Savan Kotecha composed and wrote the original songs.
                
                The Idea of You premiered at South by Southwest on March 16, 2024, and was released on Amazon Prime Video on May 2, 2024. The film received positive reviews from critics.
